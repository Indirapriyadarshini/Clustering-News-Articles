# Clustering-News-Articles
Our use of target classes allowed us to learn how our features model those targets during the training phase, which lets the algorithm set internal parameters to maximize its learning. This type of learning, where we have targets to train against, is called supervised learning. we'll consider what we do without those targets. This is unsupervised learning and it's much more of an exploratory task. Rather than wanting to classify with our model, the goal in unsupervised learning is to explore the data to find insights. we will look at clustering news articles to find trends and patterns in the data. We'll look at how we can extract data from different websites using a link aggregation website to show a variety of news stories.

The key concepts include:
. Using the reddit API to collect interesting news stories
. Obtaining text from arbitrary websites
. Cluster analysis for unsupervised data mining
. Extracting topics from documents
. Online learning for updating a model without retraining it
. Cluster ensembling to combine different models
